# VSCode Extension - Virtual Environment for Extensions

## Project Objective

This VSCode extension provides a virtual environment where only the necessary extensions for different projects are activated, and unnecessary extensions are disabled. This makes VSCode faster and more efficient. Similar to the Anaconda software used for Python development, it allows customizable extension profile management for each project.

## Features

- Define different extension profiles for each project
- Automatically enable only the necessary extensions when a project is opened
- Disable unnecessary extensions
- User-friendly interface for profile management
- Automatic extension management via a `config.json` file for each project
